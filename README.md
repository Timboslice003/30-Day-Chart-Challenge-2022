# Day 1: Part to Whole
Having a good starting QB on their rookie contract, 
allowing teams flexibility to spend money elsewhere, 
has shown to be a huge advantage. Tom Brady is good, too.\
\

# Day 2: Pictogram
The Patriots and Steelers are tied with the most 
Super Bowl wins. A handful of franchises are
still searching for their first one.\
\

# Day 3: Historical
NFL games have been higher scoring in recent years
, but surprisingly not by much.\
\
![Day_3_Historical](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/168522040-208002a8-7515-419e-8b6e-e06b3514f99e.png)

# Day 4: Flora
Here is every NFL playoff match up since 2010. I chose
2010 so every team would be represented at least
once. One interesting finding here is the most common matchup has been San
Francisco vs Green Bay, and the 49ers have won all 4 games! \
\
![Day_4_Flora](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/168523412-e176c871-ca24-4958-8936-562533c6000d.png)

# Day 5: Slope
While ideally a team has an efficient run game 
and pass game, being able to pass the ball is 
more important when it comes to winning games. 
As you can see, the correlation between winning
and a team's passing offense is stronger than winning
and their rushing offense. \
\
![Day_5_Slope](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/168697682-5981f0fa-aedc-4c9b-a031-218a88ad84dd.png)

# Day 6: Data Day
The data does not lie. The Miami Dolphins 
are the only team in NFL history to complete
an undefeated season. \
\
![Day_6_Data_Day](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/168701812-718e6e68-aa06-43d0-b620-4cae5f225500.png)

# Day 7: Physical
Using two different metrics, Expected Points Added (EPA) and PFF Team Rushing Grades, here are the best rushing teams from the 2021 NFL season.\
Learn more about EPA [here](https://www.the33rdteam.com/epa-explained/). \
\
![Day_7_Physical](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/168699971-d4ec32a8-6669-4b8a-aacf-2018628c0af0.png)

# Day 8: Mountains

# Day 9: Statistics
The distribution of each NFL player's age in 2021 shows just how wild it is Tom Brady is still playing at the level he is. The next closest player (Rams LT Andrew Whitworth who has since retired) is over 4 years younger than him!\
\
![Day_9_Statistics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/168735313-ab828741-251f-4ba7-b860-c7ed0980e2a7.png)

# Day 10: Experimental
Up until this point, all of the data has been from NFL sources. Here I experiment with a new package called CFBfastR to look at some college football data.\
\
![Day_10_Experimental](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/168734063-263f00ca-8577-4fd5-a1f1-fda1025c5e3d.png)

# Day 11: Circular
I took every team's offensive and defensive PFF grades from 2019 through 2021, and then broke those grades into tiers. When contrasting how often a team made the playoffs given their grade, it seems to show an elite offense (Tier 1) is the largest advantage in football. \
\
![Day_11_Circular](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/168735331-788f94c0-97d1-4481-a5ab-bf63aa7ec2e3.png)

# Day 12: Theme Day
Using The Economist classic theme, the following figure shows the history of Davante Adams' career. A WR receiving a new 5-year contract, worth almost $30 Million per year, just before his age 30 season is unprecedented. However, there is no sign of Adams slowing down. In fact, he just had arguably the best season of his career.\
\
![Day_12_Theme_Day](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/168737770-1e096a6a-7520-4b63-97de-56f3ca426d6f.png)

# Day 13: Correlation
There is a very strong correlation between how many yards per reception a player gets and how far down the field he catches the ball for obvious reasons. Two clear outliers here are the Bengals' Ja'Marr Chase and the 49ers' Deebo Samuel, who are two of the best WRs at getting more yards once the ball is in their hands.\
\
![Day_13_Correlation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169417819-9a997713-9626-471c-94cb-f93f91be767e.png)

# Day 14: 3-Dimensional
This is a recreated 3-D drawing of the football outside of Oregon State's Reser Stadium. [Take a look](https://arcispanel.com/wp-content/uploads/Reser_stadium_front_entrance_panels.jpg) \
\
![Day_14_3D](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169418501-447fbf75-368f-43f3-a6e7-0ae1bd9f0f12.PNG)

# Day 15: Multivariate
Rookie players are always risky to draft in fantasy football, so if you are going to pick one, you'd be better off taking one drafted in the early rounds of the NFL Draft.\
\
![Day_15_Multivariate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169419942-9e4423e1-c3e8-421c-bb81-51df31a6a637.png)

# Day 16: Environment
When plotted on a map, it is much more apparent how few teams are on the west coast.\
\
![Day_16_Environment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169421532-49fa4e4f-baa5-4230-a3bc-e251038cd4f1.png)

# Day 17: Connections
It's amazing Peyton Manning shows up on this table with two different WRs. Also, had Big Ben and Antonio Brown stuck together a few more seasons, they would have had a chance to lead the group in all three categories.\
\
![Day_17_Connections](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169424558-349594d2-db2c-4fbf-9bf3-105cfb3519f6.png)

# Day 18: Data Day
The term "Homerun Hitter" is often used as a metaphor for NFL RBs who break off long gains. These are the 10 RBs who gained the most yardage on breakaway runs last season. Some of the players are on here just because they received a lot of carries for the year. Others (Penny & Sanders) made the most out of their opportunities.\
\
![Day_18_Data_Day](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169620788-bdc849c0-b815-4fe4-b1a3-f24b65f9f418.png)

# Day 19: Global Change

# Day 20: New Tool
Using a new tool called gganimate, I created this gif of the 2022 NFL Draft showing which conferences had the most players drafted as the picks occurred. Not a great year for the ACC, Pac-12, or Big-12.\
\
![Day_20_New_Tool](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169746560-c9ed8e29-cad1-4a77-9ef1-6af7dcb7b7da.gif)

# Day 21: Down/Upwards
This is the win probability chart of the wild Chiefs-Bills playoff game. The swings in win probabiltity late in the game represents just how back and forth the end of the game was.\
\
![Day_21_Down_Up](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169750916-c623eba1-7d7d-4bab-81f7-1b2ff37eb610.png)

# Day 22: Animation
Using gganimate again, here is how each NFL team has done in the playoffs since 2002, when the Texans became the 32nd NFL franchise.\
\
![Day_22_Animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169913169-02313f99-01de-41bc-b8ed-8b45d93d25d1.gif)

# Day 23: Tiles
Similar to Day 21, this is the win probabilty chart from each of Oregon State's 2021 games against FBS opponents.\
\
![Day_23_Tiles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169914614-b5c363ca-a253-4f8f-8e05-da261df46c65.png)

# Day 24: Theme Day
Tua Tagovailoa's career has not been what the Dolphins expected when they drafted him 5th overall in the 2019 draft. I compared his adjusted net yards per attempt (ANY/A), explained [here](http://insidethepylon.com/football-101/glossary-football-101/2016/01/08/itp-glossary-adjusted-net-yards-per-attempt/), with the first 30 career game with any QB to start a playoff game in the last 20 years. He has been about on par with how they all played early in their careers, and with the addition of Tyreek Hill, may be able to take the next step in his career.\
\
![Day_24_Theme_Day](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169915752-4150f86c-b99f-4b78-9424-77075982812f.png)

# Day 25: Trend
In the last 20 years, the NFL has become more pass oriented. Last season, over half of all games had a pass rate of over 60%.\
\
![Day_25_Trend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169920873-2a46a357-599c-4012-8762-00d931de98c8.png)

# Day 26: Interactive
With my first Shiny creation, I took the win probabilty charts figure from **Day 23: Tiles** and applied it to every FBS team. Just select from a dropdown which team's schedule you would like to view. Try it yourself! [Go to Shiny App](https://timboslice003.shinyapps.io/2021_FBS_WP_Charts/?_ga=2.130225871.1999643618.1653349834-2138458318.1652158620) \
\
Here is an example using Arizona State:

# Day 27: Future
With no Power-5 out of conference games and 7 home games, Oregon State has a favorable future schedule, yet their preseason win total is currently at 5.5 by betting markets.\
\
![Day_27_Future](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169925842-3778f738-f567-479e-93bc-cab61645c819.png)

# Day 28: Deviations
Thank you to [@mrcaseb](https://github.com/mrcaseb) for the historical betting lines. Overall, Vegas is pretty good at predicting a team's season win total.\
\
![Day_28_Deviations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169925852-8733191c-61db-46fe-8b0d-a90828e148ef.png)

# Day 29: Story Telling
The Los Angeles Rams were seen as a possible Super Bowl contender all year. What was unexpected was them meeting the Cincinnati Bengals in the big game.\
\
![Day_29_Story_Telling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/169925869-7d5308f9-733f-41aa-9afa-a0cb4ffd853a.png)

# Day 30: Data Day
According to PFF receiving grades, these are the best WRs from the 2021 NFL season.\
\
