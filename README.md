# Day 1: Part to Whole
Having a good starting QB on their rookie contract, 
allowing teams flexibility to spend money elsewhere, 
has shown to be a huge advantage. Tom Brady is good, too.\

# Day 2: Pictogram
The Patriots and Steelers are tied with the most 
Super Bowl wins. A handful of franchises are
still searching for their first one.\

# Day 3: Historical
NFL games have been higher scoring in recent years
, but surprisingly not by much.\
\

# Day 4: Flora
Here is every NFL playoff match up since 2010. I chose
2010 so every team would be represented at least
once. One interesting finding here is the most common matchup has been San
Francisco vs Green Bay, and the 49ers have won all 4 games! \
\

# Day 5: Slope
While ideally a team has an efficient run game 
and pass game, being able to pass the ball is 
more important when it comes to winning games. 
As you can see, the correlation between winning
and a team's passing offense is stronger than winning
and their rushing offense. \

# Day 6: Data Day
The data does not lie. The Miami Dolphins 
are the only team in NFL history to complete
an undefeated season. \

# Day 7: Physical
Using two different metrics, Expected Points Added (EPA) and PFF Team Rushing Grades, here are the best rushing teams from the 2021 NFL season.\
Learn more about EPA [here](https://www.the33rdteam.com/epa-explained/). \

# Day 9: Statistics
The distribution of each NFL player's age in 2021 shows just how wild it is Tom Brady is still playing at the level he is. The next closest player (Rams LT Andrew Whitworth who has since retired) is over 4 years younger than him!
![Day_9_Statistics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/168735313-ab828741-251f-4ba7-b860-c7ed0980e2a7.png)

# Day 10: Experimental
Up until this point, all of the data has been from NFL sources. Here I experiment with a new package called CFBfastR to look at some college football data.\
\
![Day_10_Experimental](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/168734063-263f00ca-8577-4fd5-a1f1-fda1025c5e3d.png)

# Day 11: Circular
I took every team's offensive and defensive PFF grades from 2019 through 2021, and then broke those grades into tiers. When contrasting how often a team made the playoffs given their grade, it seems to show an elite offense (Tier 1) is the largest advantage in football. \
\

# Day 12: Theme Day
Using The Economist classic theme, the following figure shows the history of Davante Adams' career. A WR receiving a new 5-year contract, worth almost $30 Million per year, just before his age 30 season is unprecedented. However, there is no sign of Adams slowing down. In fact, he just had arguably the best season of his career.\
\
![Day_12_Theme_Day](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105609020/168737770-1e096a6a-7520-4b63-97de-56f3ca426d6f.png)

# Day 13: Correlation
There is a very strong correlation between how many yards per reception a player gets and how far down the field he catches the ball for obvious reasons. Two clear outliers here are the Bengals' Ja'Marr Chase and the 49ers' Deebo Samuel, who are two of the best WRs at getting more yards once the ball is in their hands.\
